        <p>Description: Century egg and pork congee is a classic Chinese savory congee that can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! The congee is cooked to the perfect thickness with pieces of century egg and marinated pork so that every spoonful is packed with umami.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        Congee:
        <ul>
            <li>White rice</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Century eggs</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Green Onion</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        Pork:
        <ul>
            <li>Lean pork</li>
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Shaoxing rice wine</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>White pepper</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the rice: Wash and rinse the rice 2 to 3 times, until the water is mostly clear. On the last rinse, drain most of the water, leaving enough to cover the rice. Add a teaspoon of oil and mix. Set aside and the rice soak for about 30 minutes or overnight.</li>
            <li>Marinate the pork: In a bowl, add the sliced pork, ginger, water, rice wine, salt, and a generous dash of white pepper. Mix until the liquids are absorbed by the pork. Add the cornstarch and mix until well combined. Finish with 1 teaspoon of oil and mix well.</li>
            <li>Make the congee: Add the 4 cups of water to a claypot or stainless steel pot and bring it to a boil. Add the soaked rice (water and all) and give it a stir. Cover the pot and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>When the water returns to a boil, reduce the heat to medium low or low, to keep the water at a simmer. Give the rice a stir and cover the pot. Let the congee cook for 23 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 23 to 25 minutes, the congee will look visibly thicker. Give the congee a thorough stir, especially at the bottom of the pot. Then, add the chopped century eggs. With the pot uncovered, cook the congee for 3 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Add the marinated pork to the congee and stir quickly to separate the pork slices. Cook for about 3 more minutes, or until the pork is cooked through, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Finish by adding green onions into the congee and seasoning the congee with a pinch of salt if you prefer the congee more seasoned. Then, garnish with century egg wedges and more green onions.</li>
        </ol>
