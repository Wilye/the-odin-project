        <p>Description: Chicken feet are made up of bones, skin, and tendons, but no muscles. They have many health benefits for your diet, as they are packed with calcium, protein, and cartilage which the body easily absorbs.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        Feet Ingredients:
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 lb chicken feet or paws cut tip toes off</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp dill dried</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp mustard seed whole</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp celery seed (not celery salt)</li>
            <li>2 each bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 each garlic gloves optional</li>
        </ul>
        Vinegar Brine:
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup white vinegar</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>    
            <li>Clean feet thoroughly. Use regular kitchen shears to clip off the toes.</li>
            <li>Boil the feet for 10 minutes to cook thoroughly. Place them in ice water right after boiling, for another 10 minutes. Then put them into the pint jar.</li>
            <li>Add dill, mustard seed, black peppercorns, celery seed, bay leaves, and garlic cloves (optional) to jar. Don't worry that the spices settle at the bottom; they will rise up again and evenly distribute their flavor when you add the brine.</li>
        </ol>
        Preparing Brine
        <ol>
            <li>Mix the vinegar, water, salt, and sugar in a stainless steel pan and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>As soon as it reaches a good boil, pour the brine over the mixture in the jar until the feet are just covered.</li>
            <li>Put the top on immediately and put into the refigerator.</li>
        </ol>
